# ‚úÖ Security Success Criteria - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üéØ Success Criteria Status

### ‚úÖ [COMPLETE] Container vulnerability scanning integrated
**Location**: `tests/security/security_scan.sh` (lines 115-180)
**Implementation**:
- `run_container_security_scan()` function implemented
- Support for multiple scanning tools (trivy, grype, docker scan)
- Automated vulnerability detection and reporting
- JSON output format for integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Severity-based filtering and reporting

**Verification**:
```bash
./tests/security/security_scan.sh --container-scan
```

---

### ‚úÖ [COMPLETE] Credential exposure checks pass  
**Location**: `tests/security/security_scan.sh` (lines 225-288)
**Implementation**:
- `check_credential_exposure()` function implemented
- Comprehensive pattern matching for secrets, passwords, tokens, API keys
- File type filtering (excludes binary files, focuses on config/script files)
- Smart filtering to ignore placeholder values and examples
- Detailed reporting with file locations and line numbers

**Verification**:
```bash
./tests/security/security_scan.sh --credential-check
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS - No production credential exposure detected

---

### ‚úÖ [COMPLETE] File permission auditing
**Location**: `tests/security/security_scan.sh` (lines 289-350)  
**Implementation**:
- `verify_file_permissions()` function implemented
- Systematic scanning for world-writable files
- Permission validation for different file types:
  - Scripts: 755 (executable)
  - Config files: 644 (read-only)
  - Secret files: 600 (owner-only)
- Automated remediation capabilities
- Detailed reporting with recommended fixes

**Verification**:
```bash
./tests/security/security_scan.sh --permission-audit
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS - File permission auditing mechanism fully functional

---

### ‚úÖ [COMPLETE] Network security validation
**Location**: `tests/security/security_scan.sh` (lines 351-420)
**Implementation**:
- `check_network_security()` function implemented  
- HTTPS endpoint enforcement validation
- SSL/TLS configuration checking
- Unencrypted HTTP endpoint detection
- Certificate validation capabilities
- Network communication security audit

**Additional Implementation**:
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Modified `lib/monitoring.sh` to use HTTPS for Grafana-Prometheus communication
- **TLS Configuration**: Added secure SSL settings for production deployment

**Verification**:
```bash
./tests/security/security_scan.sh --network-security
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS - Network security validation complete with HTTPS enforcement
