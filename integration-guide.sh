# A utility script to help users migrate from v2.0 to the current version.
# It performs a read-only compatibility validation of a v2.0 configuration
# file and reports on any deprecated or changed settings.
#
# Features:
#   - Compatibility Validation: Checks an old config file for known issues.
#   - Safe Integration Tool: Informs the user of required manual changes
#     without modifying any files itself.
#   - Provides clear, actionable advice for each detected issue.
#
# Dependencies: All core libs
# Required by:  Users migrating from v2.0
