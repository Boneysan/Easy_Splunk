## Error Categories Implemented

### 1. COMPOSE_FAILED
- **Triggers**: Docker/Podman compose command failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Version checks, installation verification, alternative methods
- **Commands**: Version testing, pip3 installation, native compose detection

### 2. INSTALLATION_FAILED  
- **Triggers**: Package manager and pip3 installation failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Permission checks, package cache updates, alternative methods
- **Commands**: Package manager updates, pip3 diagnostics, system requirements

### 3. RUNTIME_FAILED
- **Triggers**: Container runtime detection and operation failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Installation verification, service status, basic operations
- **Commands**: Runtime testing, service management, rootless setup

### 4. NETWORK_FAILED
- **Triggers**: Service connectivity and port accessibility issues
- **Troubleshooting**: Service status, firewall configuration, container logs
- **Commands**: Port testing, firewall management, SELinux diagnostics

### 5. PERMISSION_FAILED
- **Triggers**: File system access and ownership issues
- **Troubleshooting**: Ownership verification, permission analysis, SELinux contexts
- **Commands**: Ownership fixes, permission corrections, context management

## Before vs After Comparison

### Original Error Handling
```bash
[ERROR] Compose command failed: podman-compose
[ERROR] Installation verification failed.
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```bash
[ERROR] Compose verification failed - podman-compose not working
[INFO ] Troubleshooting steps:
[INFO ] 1. Try: podman-compose --version
[INFO ] 2. Check: pip3 list | grep podman-compose  
[INFO ] 3. Reinstall: pip3 install podman-compose==1.0.6
[INFO ] 4. Alternative: Use native 'podman compose' if available
[INFO ] 5. Verify runtime: podman --version
[INFO ] 6. Logs available at: ./install.log
```

## Testing Results

### Demonstration Script ✅
- All enhanced error functions working correctly
- Proper log file creation and referencing
- Clean error message formatting
- Comprehensive troubleshooting step display

### Integration Testing ✅
- Enhanced errors integrated into all major scripts
- Backward compatibility maintained
