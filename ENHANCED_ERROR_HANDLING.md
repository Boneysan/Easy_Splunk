# Enhanced Error Handling Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhanced error handling system implemented across the Easy_Splunk toolkit. The enhancement provides detailed troubleshooting steps, context-aware error messages, and actionable guidance for common deployment issues.

## Key Improvements

### Before (Original Error Handling)
```bash
[ERROR] Compose command failed: podman-compose
[ERROR] Installation verification failed.
```

### After (Enhanced Error Handling)
```bash
[ERROR] Compose verification failed - podman-compose not working
[INFO ] Troubleshooting steps:
[INFO ] 1. Try: podman-compose --version
[INFO ] 2. Check: pip3 list | grep podman-compose  
[INFO ] 3. Reinstall: pip3 install podman-compose==1.0.6
[INFO ] 4. Alternative: Use native 'podman compose' if available
[INFO ] 5. Verify runtime: podman --version
[INFO ] 6. Logs available at: ./install.log
```

## Enhanced Error Functions

### 1. `enhanced_compose_error()`
**Purpose**: Provides detailed troubleshooting for Docker/Podman compose issues
**Triggers**: Compose command failures, version check failures
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
- Command version verification
- Package installation checks
- Alternative installation methods
- Runtime verification

### 2. `enhanced_installation_error()`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guidance for package installation failures
**Supports**: pip3, package managers, container runtime installations
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
- Package manager updates
- Permission checks
- Alternative installation methods
- System requirement verification

### 3. `enhanced_runtime_error()`
**Purpose**: Container runtime detection and configuration issues
**Supports**: Docker, Podman, runtime switching
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
- Runtime installation verification
- Service status checks
- Permission and group membership
- Basic operation testing

### 4. `enhanced_network_error()`
**Purpose**: Network connectivity and service accessibility issues
**Supports**: Port connectivity, firewall, SELinux
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
- Service status verification
- Port connectivity testing
- Firewall configuration
- Container log analysis

### 5. `enhanced_permission_error()`
**Purpose**: File system permission and ownership issues
**Supports**: File/directory access, SELinux contexts
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
- Ownership verification
- Permission analysis
- SELinux context checking
- Corrective commands

### Error Categories

| Category | Description | Example Scenarios |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| COMPOSE_FAILED | Docker/Podman compose issues | Command not found, version failures |
| INSTALLATION_FAILED | Package installation problems | pip3 failures, package manager issues |
| RUNTIME_FAILED | Container runtime problems | Docker/Podman not working |
| NETWORK_FAILED | Connectivity issues | Port unreachable, service down |
| PERMISSION_FAILED | File system access issues | Permission denied, ownership problems |

## Usage Examples

### Testing Enhanced Errors
```bash
# Run the demonstration script
./test-enhanced-errors.sh

# Test specific error types
source lib/error-handling.sh
enhanced_compose_error "podman-compose" "test failure"
```

### Integration in Scripts
```bash
# Source the enhanced error handling
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/lib/error-handling.sh"

# Use enhanced error reporting
if ! podman-compose version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    enhanced_compose_error "podman-compose" "version check failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Benefits

### For Users
