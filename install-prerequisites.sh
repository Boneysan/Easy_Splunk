#
# A user-friendly script to install required prerequisites, primarily a
# container runtime like Docker or Podman. It provides cross-platform support
# and validates that the installation was successful.
#
# Features:
#   - Checks if prerequisites are already met.
#   - Detects the OS (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, macOS).
#   - Interactively prompts the user before running installation commands.
#   - Validates the installation by re-running the detection logic.
#
# Dependencies: lib/runtime-detection.sh (and its core dependencies)
# Required by:  Initial setup
#
