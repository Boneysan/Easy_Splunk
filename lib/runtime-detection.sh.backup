#
# Detects the available container runtime (Podman or Docker) and configures
# the environment accordingly. This is a critical script that must run before
# any container operations are attempted.
#
# Features:
#   - Prefers Podman if both runtimes are available.
#   - Detects the correct Compose command (e.g., 'docker compose' vs 'docker-compose').
#   - Performs basic health checks (e.g., is the daemon/socket running?).
#   - Exports standardized variables (CONTAINER_RUNTIME, COMPOSE_COMMAND) for
#     other scripts to use.
#
# Dependencies: core.sh, validation.sh
# Required by:  All container operations
