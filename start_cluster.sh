# Starts the application cluster and verifies that all services are healthy.
# This script provides an enhanced user experience with progress monitoring
# and integrated health checks.
#
# Features:
#   - Graceful startup of all services defined in the Compose file.
#   - Progress monitoring loop that waits for services to become healthy.
#   - Service-specific health checking with a configurable timeout.
#
# Dependencies: All core libs, runtime-detection.sh
# Required by:  End users
